# HoneyPod Frontend

The HoneyPod frontend is implemented in react. Currently, it does not talk to
the backend or the smart contract (it currently simulates them in local storage).
However, linking up the backend and the smart contract should be pretty easy.
Just implement all the functions in Backend.js and Blockchain.js and change
the environment variable from "devNoChain" in config.js
Note that since this was written quickly with cut corners before demoing, there are likely to be some bugs upon linking the backend / blockchain.

The profile page and the settings page are not yet implemented.

I planned to use the backend only to store team names, user photos, team photos,
and transaction history. The rest of the information (game state etc) lives in the
smart contract.

The web3 object and account are accessed throughout the whole app using context.

The current app is deployed using Netlify at honeypod.netlify.com. Also,
we have the domain honeypod.global which points to honeypod.netlify.com.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
